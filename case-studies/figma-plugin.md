intro: Evolving the designer experience in Figma
description: I used Cursor (AI code editor) to build a Figma plugin, allowing designers to easily create variations of a complex Side Navigation component. I was able to accomplish, on my own, what would have previously required a dedicated engineering resource. Designers can quickly iterate their Side Navigation elements without the need to submit a ticket for a library update.

{% include section-title.html label="Summary" %}

{% include copy-block-note.html copy="This summary shows the steps I took to build this proprietary Figma plugin. I'd be happy to present a more detailed case study, and demo the plugin, at your convenience!" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As we moved into FY26, Walmart's business leadership encouraged design and tech teams to embrace AI tools, and find ways to use them to improve our workflows. I saw this as an opportunity to leverage my previous front-end development experience, and I built a plugin to automate the customization of a complex component." %}

{% include section-title.html label="Challenge" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="One of the largest component sets in the PX Pattern Library, a Walmart Enterprise pattern library, is the Side Navigation component set. The 'Side Nav' component set is made up of multiple atoms, molecules, and organisms. It's highly flexible, and it's organized in the library in such a way that library maintainers can recreate variations for any product in Walmart's Enterprise business pillar." %}

{% include figure-big.html image="case-studies/figma-plugin-sidenav.png" caption="PX Pattern Library SideNav components" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="One downside of such complex components is that time consuming collaboration with the pattern library team is required when someone needs a variation or iteration. To maintain library integrity, and to ensure that new variations are constructed correctly, users must:" %}

- File a ticket with the pattern library team.
- Submit a hierarchy of parent/child links requested in the new variation.
- Wait for the pattern library team to:
	- Build the new variation in a library branch.
	- Go through the review/approval/merge process for the work, in Figma.
	- Publish & release the new/updated components in the library.

{% include copy-block.html copy="Since engineers use the same atoms & molecules to construct a Side Nav, in React, it's fortunately easy for them to follow design comps when parent and child links change. But the design process is slower than we'd like it to be." %}

{% include section-title.html label="Opportunity" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="I saw this as a great candidate for Figma plugin exploration. If a user can fill in a form, in a plugin UI, and output the assembled component set to their design file, they would require no involvement on the part of the pattern library team. Designers can iterate as many versions of the Side Nav as needed, and dispose of any previous versions. As long as they don't change its foundational structure (spacing, font sizes, etc.), engineers can use the system components in React." %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Step 1: The plugin development environment" %}

Figma provides extensive information in their [Plugin Quickstart Guide](link https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/). I have enough experience with HTML/CSS, Node, JavaScript & TypeScript to spin up the skeleton of a basic plugin.

{% include copy-block.html copy="My first impression of Cursor was that it's a clone of VS Code with a built-in engineering partner. 🤓" %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Step 2: The plugin modal UI" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As a designer with coding experience, getting the plugin modal UI set up was fairly easy. I was able to add the necessary JavaScript to manipulate the DOM based on user input." %}

- User adds/removes as many parent-child navigation groups as needed.
- Enter link labels into the input fields.
- Click **Run plugin**.

{% include section-title.html label="Output" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Upon running the plugin, the user will get the following output, on their artboard:" %}

- One component set for each parent/child group, with variants for every possible active state of the parent and child links.
- The "MySideNav" component, which is made up of:
	- A "Home" link, which appears by default
	- The collapsed variant of each parent/child group
- The [PX] SideNav-MySideNav organism. This is the component designers would place into their template.

<!--
{% include section-title.html label="Next steps" %}

- While the icons are easy to change manually, it would be helpful to include an additional form element (a Select, for example) in the plugin UI, allowing the user to choose each leading icon variant.
- It could eliminate confusion if designers filled in another form element with the name of their app or team, and the component would be named accordingly when it's generated. They can do this manually, but adding in the automation would be an extra bonus.
- A video tutorial would be helpful for designers using this plugin for the first time. As always, education and outreach goes a long way, when delivering new design system tools.

{% include section-title.html label="Learnings" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Overall, I'm pretty amazed at how easy it is to build a complex Figma plugin, using Cursor's conversational UI. I think it's definitely still a requirement that someone building a Figma plugin with Cursor have a comfortable level of knowledge of JavaScript, in order to write effective prompts. But it allowed me to complete this task without involving an engineering partner. I would want a qualified engineer to help with some debugging, and to review the code before shipping, but the ability to do this without taking up the design system's engineering resources was highly rewarding!" %}
