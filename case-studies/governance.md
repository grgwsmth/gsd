intro: Design system governance
description: I designed and documented a governance workflow for our core system (which evolved over time, as the team evolved). I created a similar version of that process for an enterprise pattern library, as we scaled the core system into our primary business pillars.

{% include copy-block.html copy="I was part of the zero-to-one effort that built the first centralized, governed design system library at Walmart. I designed and documented a governance workflow to achieve two goals:" %}

- Improve the agile collaboration process on our team.
- Socialize our team's methodologies to manage user expectations.

- It helps communicate the team's capacity.
- It sets user expectations, when requesting updates and iterations.
- It ensures the work we deliver will be stable and reliable on all platforms.
- Define the scope of our team within the design organization.
- Define basic roles and responsibilities of designers and engineers on our team.
- Communicate "how we work" principles to new system team members, product design users, engineering users, product partners, and business partners.
- Manage the flow of work.
- Manage user expectations when making requests of the team.

{% include section-title.html label="Challenge" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="When Walmart's design system team was new and growing, we needed to establish a defined set of processes that would add structure to our team, and serve as a public SLA (service level agreement) with our users. A few examples of the basic things we needed to define and document:" %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Internal" %}

- What does it mean to design, develop and ship a reusable component on all platforms? How long should that take?
- What tools and artifacts will we use in our work? What are the expected deliverables?
- How are the collaborate methods and standards for design/eng/a11y?

{% include case-study-h3.html label="External" %}

- What is the design system team responsible for?
- How do I interact with the team when I need support?
- Will the team commit to my feature request? If no, why not? If yes, how long will it take?

{% include section-title.html label="Solution" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="The first process I defined and documented was the basic lifecycle of new work. Clearly defining the steps involved in zero-to-one work on library components would also help us define updates and iterations. It would help us educate users on the nature of feature requests and contribution, and it would help manage user expectations." %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="This is an excerpt of v1 of our team process. It became an artifact that we referred to as a team, to improve collaboration. We used it in communication with product teams, so they could understand what's involved when they engage us." %}

{% include figure.html image="case-studies/governance-v2-1.png" alt="Flowchart of Living Design process" caption="Excerpt of Living Design's component creation lifecycle" %}

{% include section-title.html label="Evolution" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As the team took on more (and more complex) work, I continually iterated this documented process to add clarity and structure." %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Again, the screenshot below is highly detailed, and difficult to consume in this format, but it's a good demonstration of how we were rigorous in the way we defined our work. I'd of course be happy to go deeper into the process and methodology defined below, directly in Figma, in a full case study. 🤓" %}

{% include figure-big.html image="case-studies/governance-1.png" caption="Intricate roadmap" %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="A zoomed-in sample:" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="The cropped section below shows a bit more clarity. This represents our efforts to define every step in our team's process. The idea was that, if all steps could be accounted for, we minimize the chance of shipping artifacts that fail to meet user needs." %}

{% include figure.html image="case-studies/governance-1a.png" caption="Intricate roadmap section" %}

{% include section-title.html label="Learnings" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="The intricacy of this workflow proved to be challenging in the course of a busy, demanding team sprint. It's important to find a balance between progress and process. Too much process can hinder progress." %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Tested over time, individual sections of this documentation were helpful tools to introduce new team members to the intricacies of design system work. But, taken as a whole, it was difficult to use as a strict tool for team collaboration. Team members need to be trusted to manage their own individual tasks with a bit more freedom." %}

{% include case-study-h3.html label="Simplified approach" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As a design system (and its team) gains maturity, it's easier to embrace the progress-over-process ideal. Individual team members have a more concrete understanding of expectations. It's important that we hit key milestones in our process, but it's more important that we do so with realistic velocity." %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="Defining a process more simply allows the team to adhere to the most fundamental best practices, while not getting bogged down in micro-management of their work." %}

{% include figure-big.html image="case-studies/governance-2.png" caption="Simplified approach" %}

Users will commonly ask why a design system task can't be completed on a timeline that aligns with delivery of their product. This is an artifact we can share that demonstrates the necessary steps we take, and clearly explains how system work is intentionally different than product work.
