{% include figure.html image="case-studies/pattern-libraries-2.png" alt="PX Pattern Library impact" %}

- We delivered a robust pattern library, extending Walmart's core design system, containing molecules, organisms, and templates to address needs specific to Walmart's Enterprise business pillar.
- Our product set the roadmap to replace multiple single, independently managed libraries.
- I ensured that all components and patterns were built in accordance with the design system team's established best practices and processes.
- I applied the core system's design tokens and foundations to all library artifacts, allowing for stability, consistency, and future theme capability.
- I helped install and maintain a governance model to support ~60 designers, ~200 web engineers.
- I delivered detailed engineering specifications for components and patterns, and collaborated with our engineering partners during the development and QA processes.

{% include copy-block.html copy="Below are examples of a component I built, with all variants and states, and some page templates. The intent of this library was for designers to drag page templates, as a starting point, and place components & patterns into their content slots to make customizations." %}

{% include section-title.html label="Key takeaways" %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="My work on this library represents the first effort the Walmart design system team made in a direct collaboration with a product team to deliver more complex patterns and templates, beyond the global atoms & molecules of the core system." %}

{% include copy-block.html copy="As the design system lead on this project, I was able to set the roadmap for how Walmart approaches design systems at scale, and methods for both internal team collaboration and governance of the library as a product." %}
